# Pattern-Defeating-Merge-Sort
A custom made sort that preforms very well on nearly sorted lists.
# Usage
The file lib.rs contains one public function, sort, which is a "fn (Vec<usize>) -> Vec<usize>" and sorts numbers from smallest to largest. To change the type of the numbers being sorted, find and replce "usize" with the type you would like to use.
